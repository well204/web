        <p>3. The Terracotta Army in Xi'an — 2,000-Year-Old Underground Army</p>
        <p>The Terracotta Army has been laid underground for more than 2,000 years. However, in 1974, farmers digging a well uncovered one of the greatest archaeological sites in the world. In 1987 it became World Cultural Heritage.

         <p>Giant Pandas in Chengdu — China's "National Treasure"</p>
         <p>The giant panda is not only deeply loved by the Chinese, but by many foreigners too, and not just children. Although there are many zoos in China and elsewhere, where you can see a giant panda, the best place to see them is Chengdu — the giant panda's "hometown".

            There are three places you can see pandas close up: Chengdu Panda Breeding and Research Center, Dujiangyan Panda Valley, and Bifengxia Panda Base.
            
                Chengdu Panda Center is in the north of the city and is more established.
                Dujiangyan and Bifengxia Panda Bases are 1-2 hours from Chengdu and you can see pandas in their natural habitat.</p>
